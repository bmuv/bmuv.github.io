## Work Experience

**Machine Learning Engineer Intern @ The Rwanda Space Agency (_Summer 2022_)**
- Conducted exploratory data analysis on geospatial images to monitor and quantify deforestation and forest
  degradation in remote areas of Rwanda.
- Optimized sequence deep learning models (RNN, LSTM, GRU) for image segmentation to achieve higher
  accuracy and precision on geospatial images.
- Collaborated with team members to develop comprehensive reports and engaging presentations to effectively
  communicate project findings and insights to stakeholders and team members.

**Cofounder & Data Lead @ Extra Technologies Ltd**
- Developed and led the implementation of a cooperative management platform that increased efficiency in
  daily operations for over 16 cooperatives with 5000 members, resulting in a 15% reduction in overhead costs.
- Created analytics dashboards using PowerBi to track and analyze member performance for Tea Cooperatives.

## Projects

**Frame-Level Speech Recognition using Multilayer Perceptron**
## Overview
Developed an advanced frame-level speech recognition system using a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP).
This project focused on transforming raw Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) into precise phonetic transcriptions at the frame level.
## Key Responsibilities
- Engineered an MLP model to learn feature representations and establish a non-linear classification boundary for speech recognition.
- Employed cross-entropy loss to minimize the discrepancy between the predicted outputs and the target phoneme class labels.
- Utilized gradient descent algorithms for neural network parameter optimization, aimed at reducing the overall cost function and enhancing model precision.
## Achievements
- Successfully developed a neural network capable of distinguishing between diverse phonetic sounds in speech.
- Achieved a high model accuracy with a score of 0.87693, demonstrating advanced proficiency in speech processing and machine learning techniques.
