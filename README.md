- Developed and led the implementation of a cooperative management platform that increased efficiency in
  daily operations for over 16 cooperatives with 5000 members, resulting in a 15% reduction in overhead costs.
- Created analytics dashboards using PowerBi to track and analyze member performance for Tea Cooperatives.

## Projects

**Frame-Level Speech Recognition using Multilayer Perceptron**
[code](https://github.com/bmuv)
### Overview
Developed an advanced frame-level speech recognition system using a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP).
This project focused on transforming raw Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) into precise phonetic transcriptions at the frame level.
### Key Responsibilities
- Engineered an MLP model to learn feature representations and establish a non-linear classification boundary for speech recognition.
- Employed cross-entropy loss to minimize the discrepancy between the predicted outputs and the target phoneme class labels.
- Utilized gradient descent algorithms for neural network parameter optimization, aimed at reducing the overall cost function and enhancing model precision.
### Achievements
- Successfully developed a neural network capable of distinguishing between diverse phonetic sounds in speech.
- Achieved a high model accuracy with a score of 0.87693, demonstrating advanced proficiency in speech processing and machine learning techniques.

**Face Classification & Verification using Convolutional Neural Networks**
[code](https://github.com/bmuv)
### Overview
- Implemented a ResNet architectures for face verification, focusing on constructing effective convolutional neural networks and generating discriminative, generalizable feature representations.
- Implemented a face classifier to extract and analyze facial features (like skin tone, hair color, nose size) from images, converting them into fixed-length feature vectors or face embeddings.
- Designed a verification system to compute the similarity between feature vectors of two images, determining if they represent the same person.
### Key Achievements
- Successfully trained a model that can distinguish facial features with high accuracy, thereby enhancing the performance of face verification tasks.
- Developed and optimized a model capable of effectively comparing feature vectors to generate a similarity score, crucial for accurate identity verification.
